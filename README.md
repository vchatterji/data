# Data

This is a repository for fun (geeky) data analysis stuff.

Click on a folder and then the .ipynb file to view.

# You can do this too

If you like what you see, you can download Anaconda from [here](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).

Once installed, go to the folder where you cloned this project and run:

```
jupyter notebook
```

That should open up a browser window where you can run the file.
